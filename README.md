# Dear ImGui for Haxe

Haxe bindings for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

This library is a continuation of the great work from @Aidan63 on [linc_imgui](https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_imgui).

---

imgui-hx can currently be used with the following Haxe targets:
- C++
- Javascript (using [jsimgui](https://github.com/mori2003/jsimgui))

---
### Install

`haxelib git imgui-hx https://github.com/jeremyfa/imgui-hx`

### Usage (C++)

The API follows the ImGui C++ API with most functions and attributes having a haxe equivalent with the same name. When the API wants a ImTextureID (c++ void*) you can use the cpp.Pointer class and rawCast() / reinterpret() to convert to and from whatever classes your framework uses.

For functions which take and modify a float (e.g. colour edits, float inputs / sliders) the float must be a cpp.Float32 type, not a default Haxe float. When creating types such as Vec2 and Vec4 the floats passed to the create method do not need to be explicitly defined as a cpp.Float32 since it is not permanently modifying that variable.

### Usage (Javascript)

The JS backend now follows `jsimgui`'s public ESM runtime instead of the old `imgui-js` UMD runtime.

That keeps `imgui.ImGui` as the main Haxe import path, but the JS API is intentionally `jsimgui`-shaped and no longer promises full call-site parity with the C++ backend.

Mutable JS inputs now use boxed one-element arrays such as `boxFloat(0.5)` and `boxBool(true)`.

### Reporting errors

This is a new binding so there's bound to be missing and / or non-working functions and features. If you find them please create a new issue so it can be fixed. Pull Requests are also welcome.

### Setup in project/engine

There is no setup guide at the moment, but if you want to setup and use Dear ImGui into your own project/engine, you could take a look at the [imgui plugin](https://github.com/ceramic-engine/ceramic/tree/master/plugins/imgui/runtime/src/ceramic) for ceramic engine, which contain code to make Dear ImGui work with both C++ and JS targets.

When targetting C++, it is using Dear ImGui's built-in backend (SDL + opengl) which should make integration easier on your own engine, if based on opengl as well.

When targetting JS, bootstrap the repo once with:

```bash
bun install
```

That now does the local workspace setup for you:
- clones/updates `lib/cimgui` and `lib/jsimgui`
- installs `lib/jsimgui`'s node dependencies
- installs a local Emscripten toolchain under `.deps/emsdk`
- installs Python `ply` into a local environment under `.deps/python` when `venv` is available, or falls back to a repo-local Python user base under `.deps/python-user`

Then build the `jsimgui` runtime with:

```bash
bun run build:js
```

If you only want the runtime build without regenerating Haxe externs, run:

```bash
bun run build:jsimgui
```

The generated runtime lives under:
- `lib/jsimgui/build/mod.js`
- `lib/jsimgui/build/jsimgui.em.js`
- `lib/jsimgui/build/mod.d.ts`

Then load the generated runtime from your page or app code with `imgui.JsRuntime.load('/lib/jsimgui/build/mod.js')` before calling `imgui.ImGuiImplWeb.init(...)`.

ImGui's Metal/DirectX backends are not handled in imgui-hx bindings yet, and when using SDL + opengl, it is expected that your project uses `linc_sdl` and `linc_opengl` libraries, but pull requests are welcome to make the bindings work with more various environments.

Once everything is setup, you can, in any haxe file of your project:

1. Import Dear ImGui and additional haxe helpers

```haxe
import imgui.ImGui;
import imgui.Helpers.*;
```

2. Start creating UI by adding code that is executed at every frame of your app

```haxe
var someFloatValue = boxFloat(0.0);

function someUpdateLoopMethod() {

    // Create a small ImGui window to edit a float value

    ImGui.begin('Hello');
    
    ImGui.sliderFloat('Some slider', someFloatValue, 0.0, 1.0);
    
    if (someFloatValue[0] == 1.0) {
        ImGui.text('Float value is at MAX (1.0)');
    }
    
    ImGui.end();

}
```

See [test/js/README.md](test/js/README.md) for a complete browser demo that loads `jsimgui`, initializes `imgui.ImGuiImplWeb`, and renders Dear ImGui on a canvas.
